# My programming assignment for lachine learning course Week-2

In this assignment,I will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) it's for free and it will help you a lot.
- This assignment implemented using Octave and python (from scratch) and also using python packages to make it easy to implement it in new and feature projects.

## Using Octave

### Requirement

Firstival for Octave implementation is a programing assignment to complet the secound week in maching learning coursera course by Andew Ng [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
- The firts think you need to install Octave in your computer [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html).
- If you are a beginner in Octave programing it's better to check file ex1.pdf because this file has all step that you need to successful we that.
- You can also use Matlab programing language

### Running the tests
#### Dataset
Our dataset that we use
- *ex1data1.txt* - Dataset for linear regression with one variable 
- *ex1data2.txt* - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables
#### Functions
Those files content the function that we will need.
[->] *warmUpExercise.m* - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB 
[->] *plotData.m* - Function to display the dataset 
[->] *computeCost.m* - Function to compute the cost of linear regression 
[->] *gradientDescent.m* - Function to run gradient descent 
[->] *computeCostMulti.m* - Cost function for multiple variables 
[->] *gradientDescentMulti.m* - Gradient descent for multiple variables 
[->] *featureNormalize.m* - Function to normalize features 
[->] *normalEqn.m* - Function to compute the normal equations
#### Test
Those files content our test for linear regression for one variable and for multi variable call all functions that we had completed in the previous step.
- *ex1.m* - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise 
- *ex1 multi.m* - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise 
[->] First run the *ex1.m* to see all iterations for one variable than you can go to *ex1_multi.m* for multi variables.
